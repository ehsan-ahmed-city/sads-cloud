What counts as suspicious?

Too many login attempts in short time

Logins at unusual hours for that user

Repeated failures followed by success

Rapid repeated logins

Features that indicate this

Time of day

Login success/failure

Frequency

Time since last login

Strictness

Aggressive detection

False positives is more manageable than false negatives

Deliverable:

A login is anomalous if it changes significantly from a user’s login pattern pattern  history in time or frequency. Since in principle the solution would be handling big-data for organisations that could be handling sensitive info like hospitals or banks, it's better to have aggressive detection because a false positive is far less catastrophic than a false positive.
