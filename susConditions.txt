Suspicious conditions (policy):

High attempt rate 
- e.g (5 logins in 2 minutes)

Failures then success pattern (brute force)
- <5 failed logins within 5 minutes

Unusual time-of-day for that user (or globally if no history)
- 11pm -> 6am

Rapid repeated logins (token abuse / scripted activity)
- 5 successful logins within 10 minutes

Features to compute (for ML):

hourOfDay (0–23)
- e.g. sus = 23 -> 06

dayOfWeek (0–6)
- monday = 0 sunday = 6

success (0/1)
- boolean

failuresLast10m
- per user, added when failed login

attemptsLast10m
- per user, added when attempted login, failed or accepted


timeSinceLastLoginSec
- seconds since last login
- e.g. 21600 = 6 hours



Prefer catching suspicious activity even if some false positives happen.
